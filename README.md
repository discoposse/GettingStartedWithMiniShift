# **Getting Started with MiniShift* 
This is the repository of examples and links that we used for a [Turbonomic Labs](https://turbonomic.com/labs) live stream on July 23, 2020.

MiniShift is a nifty tool for getting started with testing out OpenShift using a local lab so you don't need ot spin up cloud resources or have a dedicated server set up for it.
